## Thunderbird Lightning Calender

https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/calendar/

I chose Thunderbird because it can help person that are very unorganised and or very busy
to keep track of their busy scheduled and be able to live their lives efficiently.

## WordPress

https://wordpress.org/

I chose WordPress because it allows someone who either wants to blog about events and random stuff
to document and allow person to read such documenations quite easier.
